<h1>ckSurf 1.21 (ez autohop seattle bespoke ver)</h1>

<p>This is a severely stripped down version of ckSurf intended only to provide support for stages and stage splits on a server concurrently running shavitush's bhoptimer. Still under development. Be sure to use the included cfg/sourcemod/ckSurf.cfg rather than the autogenerated version.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul><li>ckSurf has no concept of styles, so that needs to be implemented into both run times storage as well as checkpoint storage.</li>
	<li>Staged maps that already have times recorded on bhoptimer would require faked checkpoint values for SR +/- calculation, which would be unrealistic (optimistically, really it'd be hopelessly incorrect). Those maps will need their records dropped prior to implementing this on the server proper in order for SR splits to be accurate.</li>
</ul>
